Getting Started With Wii Linux
==============================

Welcome to your new Wii Linux install!  This guide will show you how
to use a few basic functions of your system.

A few notes on the formatting of this guide:

- A word with brackets, like "this[5]" refers to a section number.
  If you want more info about that topic, skip to that section of the guide.

- You may use the Page Up and Page Down keys on your keyboard to scroll
  around quickly, or use the arrow keys to move around one line at a time.

- A word (or set of words) wrapped in `backticks` is a command that you can
  execute on your system.


1. Basic system navigation
==========================

To change between TTYs, press Alt+F1 through Alt+F12 on your keyboard.
The system boots up on TTY1 (Alt+F1).

You'll need to know how to do this for the rest of the guide, so practice
with it now if you need it.  Press Alt+F2 to switch to TTY2, then Alt+F1
to get back to this manual.

For the rest of the guide, if you would like to run a command, while keeping
the guide running, you can, and should, switch TTYs to do so, rather than
exiting and re-entering the guide every time.

To exit this guide at any time, press 'Q' on your keyboard.


2. Setting up networking access
===============================

You'll probably want to give your Wii access to the internet.
Your install of Wii Linux ArchPOWER comes with NetworkManager by default.
You can use this to set up networking.

Firstly, you'll want to verify that your network adapter is detected:
        To check if it's supported, you can run `ip a` from the shell.
        
        'wlan0' is the internal WiFi adapter (Broadcom 4318).

        If you see a device name starting with 'en', or 'eth', that's your
        USB Ethernet adapter.

        If you see a device name starting with 'wl' that is NOT 'wlan0',
        that's your USB WiFi adapter.

        If you don't see it, your adapter may not be supported by this
        kernel version.  You may want to contact support[4] if you
        want to check.
        
Here's a few cases for how you could do so:
  - Connection via Ethernet with DHCP
        It should just work out of the box, assuming that your
        USB NIC is supported by the Linux 4.5 kernel.

        If it's not working, check that the cable is clicked all the way
        in on both sides.  If it's still not working, or you don't see
        the interface name, contact support[4].

  - Connection via Ethernet with a static address
        You can configure this with NetworkManager.

        Firstly, check that your NIC is supported.  If it is, then you should
        see it's interface.

        If so, then you can set it up like you would any other
        Ethernet interface, using `nmcli` or `nmtui`.

        An example in `nmtui`:
        1.  Start `nmtui`.
        2.  Choose 'Edit a connection'.
        3.  Pick your adapter - probably 'Wired connection 1'.
        4.  Select 'IPv4 CONFIGURATION', set the type to '<Manual>'.
        5.  To the right, select '<Show>'.
        6.  To the right of 'Addresses', select '<Add...>'.
        7.  Enter your desired IP address and subnet mask, e.g.
            192.168.0.10/24
        8.  To the right of gateway, enter your desired gateway/router, e.g.
            192.168.0.1
        9.  (optional) To the right of DNS servers, select '<Add...>'.
        10. (optional) Enter your desired DNS server.
        11. Move down to the bottom and select '<OK>' to save your changes.

  - Connection via builtin (b43) WiFi with DHCP
        You can configure this with NetworkManager.

        You can set up WiFi like you would with any other WiFi adapter
        under NetworkManager, using `nmcli` or `nmtui`.
        
        Here's how you would do it under `nmtui`.
        1.  Start `nmtui`.
        2.  Chose 'Activate a connection'.
        3.  Chose your WiFi network, under the Wi-Fi section.
            Don't see anything?  Try pressing 'ESC' on your keyboard a few
            times to exit out of `nmtui`, then try starting it back up again.
            Still don't see it?  Contact support[4].
        4.  If your network requires a password, NetworkManager will prompt
            you for it.  Enter it, and it should connect.
            If it didn't connect (asking you for the password again), you
            likely typed it wrong.  If it keeps doing this, but you're
            sure that you entered it correctly, contact support[4].
        5.  You're now connected!
            Exit `nmtui` by following the path, or press 'ESC' a few times.

  - Connection via builtin (b43) WiFi with a static address
        Follow the guide for setting it up with DHCP above, then
        once done, follow the guide for setting up static Ethernet,
        replacing 'Wired connection 1' with your WiFi network name.

  - Connection via USB WiFi (DHCP or static)
        Follow the above guides, but while connecting to the WiFi,
        ensure to chose the network listed under your USB adapter,
        rather than the builtin one.
